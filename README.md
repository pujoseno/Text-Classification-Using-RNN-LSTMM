# Text-Classification-Using-RNN-LSTMM
How text classification work in RNN and LSTM with Keras and Tensorflow

Step:
1. The data
Using data Consumer Complaints Dataset for NLP you can find in this [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/consume-complaints-dataset-fo-nlp).
2. Pre Processing
Cleaning data
4. Modelling
Create Modelling LSTM
6. Predict New Data
Predict with New data
